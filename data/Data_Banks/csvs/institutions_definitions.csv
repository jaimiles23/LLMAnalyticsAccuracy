SUBCHAPS,Subchapter S Corporations,"The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 changed the Internal Revenue Code to allow financial institutions to elect Subchapter S corporation status, beginning in 1997. Banks are required to indicate on the Call Report whether there is currently in effect an election to file under Subchapter S. Thrifts have a similar requirement as of March 1998. The most important IRS requirements to elect and maintain Subchapter S status are: There can be no more than 75 eligible shareholders and no more than one class of stock. (In general, shareholders can only be individuals, estates, and certain types of trusts. Certain retirement plans and charitable organizations will be eligible in 1998.) All shareholders must consent. Banks and thrifts converting to Subchapter S status must use the specific charge-off method for tax purposes rather than the reserve method of accounting for bad debts and recapture tax bad debt reserves over a period of six years, if the reserve method had been used prior to conversion. (Note: even though the specific charge-off method is required for tax purposes, an adequate allowance for loan and lease losses must still be maintained on the financial statements and Call Reports.) Banks and thrifts are subject to a built-in gains (BIG) tax, if the aggregate fair market value of assets is greater than their aggregate adjusted bases on the date of conversion to Subchapter S status. [Banks are required to indicate separately on the Call Report in December of each year, the deferred portion of income taxes reported in net income. For Subchapter S banks, some or all of their deferred tax assets and liabilities may be eliminated upon conversion to Subchapter S status; however, deferred taxes related to the BIG tax and the recapture of bad debt reserves must be recognized.]. A Subchapter S corporation is treated as a pass-through entity, similar to a partnership, for federal income tax purposes. It is generally not subject to any federal income taxes at the corporate level. Its taxable income flows through to its shareholders in proportion to their stock ownership, and the shareholders generally pay federal income taxes on their share of this taxable income. This can have the effect of reducing institutions' reported income tax expense and increasing their after-tax earnings.. The election of Subchapter S status may result in an increase in shareholders' personal tax liabilities. Therefore, S corporations typically increase the amount of earnings distributed as dividends to compensate for higher personal taxes."
